# Day 1: Thursday 26 March

Goals today:

- [x] Set up this repo
- [x] Clean the bathroom sink
- [x] Clear the dining table
- [x] Cook a delicious chicken and mushroom pasta bake
- [x] Video calls
    - [x] Kyle & Jack
    - [x] Julie
    - [x] Locomotive crew

Woke up about 6:30; flicked through Twitter and checked in on Pen Island. Animal Crossing is cute as hell but even by day 3 it's starting to feel a little hollow. Perhaps it's just meant to be meditative? Anyway, it's not quite hitting the spot after 150+ hours in Breath of the Wild. Maybe it's time for another Diablo playthrough (Demon Hunter?): something I don't have to think about too much and won't give me any stress, but with a little more pace.

Work is easy to get absorbed in. Plenty to do, including things I've been putting off for a while, so it's a nice balance between what I'm "supposed" to be doing and what's going to keep me occupied/satisfied. It's a win/win because I'm getting more done with fewer interruptions, and the bonus outcome is some nice features I wouldn't have had time to work on normally.

Kicking myself for forgetting to buy new guitar strings before it was too late. My acoustic sorely needs them, and trying to play it now will be a bad time. So I guess I treat that as a creative constraint, and play more with electric, bass, or ukulele. I'd love to say I'd finally have the time to mess around with a keyboard a little more, but I think realistically that ship has sailed.

Still looking for a really meaty side project. I do have a half-finished Sudoku solver that I could put more time into: the solvers for the harder techniques are really nice self-contained challenges and I could easily knock one of them off every couple of days.

### Later

I did everything I said I was gonna do today! I also:

- [x] Downloaded a new workout app (thanks Julie)
- [x] Went for a walk
- [x] Started a jigsaw puzzle
- [x] Watched a shit-ton of The Wire (finished S1 and a good chunk of S2)

### Grateful for

* 💻 Video chat man, oh my god. I cannot imagine what this would be like without it.
* 🥚 The two perfectly-poached eggs I made for lunch.
* 🍷 The unopened bottle of pinot gris I found in the fridge unexpectedly.
* 👩🏻 Tara's sage and well-informed advice. That woman is working her butt off to keep us all alive.
* 💪 That actually goes for everyone working to keep NZ healthy, but Tara's my fav.

# Day 2: Friday 27 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Fold all the washing
- [x] Clean the kitchen
- [x] Start a "to-watch" list

Up at 8 after a much deeper sleep. So many vivid social-distancing-themed dreams. Also I think there was some karaoke in there?

Also I'm super hungry, which isn't great. Once I get done with this morning's meetings I'll get some breakfast inside my body. Fridays are so meeting-heavy in general, which is going to be interesting: I find meetings exhausting in person and even more so over a video link, so today when I have like five hours of meetings it's gonna feel like a (quick maths) 13-hour day.

Looking forward to my first Bubble Visit later on. I'm pretty certain it's all above board, I'm just nervous things will tighten up in a few days and I'll be stuck by myself 😬

Friday, lessgo.

# Day 3: Saturday 28 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Clean the bathroom
- [ ] Finish my jigsaw

Didn't really finish this yesterday — forgot to do my gratitude stuff etc. So, I'm grateful for my lil bubble. Spent the evening on House Party and playing Trivial Pursuit, which was fun.

The weather this morning is real crappy, which wouldn't ordinarily be a problem except my house is SO LOUD when it rains. So I made some brunch and now I'm curled up on the couch making plans for the day but it's already 1pm.

But it's the weekend. I don't have to have a plan, right? Right?

### Update

I did none of these things! None of them! I didn't even do my workout! And I'm completely fine with that. It's Saturday baybee.

# Day 4: Sunday 29 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Tidy up a bit
- [x] Relax
- [ ] FaceTime with Rachelle in NYC
- [x] Movie date
- [x] Investigate Improfest Online

Went to the supermarket this morning for the first time. So weird. Also, some people really don't know how far two metres is, or even how many people one person from your household is. Surprised myself by getting a bunch of stuff for meals I wouldn't normally cook and feeling positive, even excited, about the idea. I don't know how it'll turn out afterwards, but for now I'm trying to use the extra time and energy in a positive way. Slightly annoyed at myself that I forgot to ask Kate if she needed anything before I went, but also I forgot flour, so I might need to go back anyway.

Not sure what I'll end up doing today. At the moment I'm watching TV with the subtitles on because the rain is too loud, which means I can't just have it on in the background while I do other things, but I'm kind of feeling like Doing A Project.

### Later

Spent a chunk of the afternoon reading Shakespeare's Comedy Of Errors (aggressively abridged) over a Zoom call for Lyndon's birthday, and it was very silly fun. Then I cooked my favourite pasta (pumpkin and caramelised onion ravioli — just from a packet, but delicious and relatively inexpensive), browned some butter to go with it (a first) and promptly burned my tongue (sadly not a first). So any ensuing anosmia is not (necessarily) a symptom.

Apart from that, I've spent most of the day lying on the couch with Trip on my chest watching TV, including watching (and live-tweeting) most of The Fellowship Of The Ring. It's... very silly. Needs some drastic editing: it could make a very decent 110 or so minutes, but 3 hours? No thanks.

"Back" "to" "work" tomorrow. Some stuff didn't get done this weekend, but also I haven't devolved into some kind of blanket-fort troglodyte quite yet, which is oddly surprising. I'm at peace with my decisions.

- [x] Set up shared grocery list with Kate
- [x] Did workout (ugh, cardio this time)
- [x] Checked Animates order: not yet picked up by NZ Post
- [ ] Still didn't finish the jigsaw. It taunts me.

### Grateful for

- 🏪 Supermarket staff
- 💻 Internet connectivity
- 🍳 Easy recipes
- 🐈 Cat snugs
- 🥵 A workout that only lasts 8 minutes

# Day 5: Monday 30 March

I have a headache. **It is just a headache.**

I totalled it up and I have 18 hours of video calls scheduled for work this week. This is clearly unsustainable. At least, I hope it is. EIGHTEEN HOURS.

Apart from those two things, I'm good. Just had a whole-family video chat for Tim's birthday, and I'm very glad I got him an entirely digital present (even before all this happened). Ihaia and Tāwera sent me pictures to go in my picture frames, but I think I'm just gonna put them up on the wall in the study.

I'm also extremely happy to report that before I started work this morning I put a bunch of pork and juices and spices into my slow cooker, so in a couple of hours I should be ready to take that out, break it up with forks, and crisp it in the oven for some delicious carnitas to put in tacos forever (1.2kg pork divided by just me equals a lot of porks per me).

Also spent some time today helping Brendon out with Dungeons & Comedians, which was very fun. I need to finish making my character for Wednesday's D&D session (unrelated), or at least come up with a name.

I'm feeling alright. I'm hearing a lot more people noise outside than I'd expect, though 🤔

Retrospective goals for today:

- [x] Cook some delicious pork
- [x] Clean up after myself
- [ ] Name my character
- [x] Draw pictures for Ihaia and Tāwera
- [ ] Finish FotR?
- [x] Watch more Veronica Mars

# Day 6: Tuesday 31 March

A rough night, bad sleep, gross dreams. Got to work out how to do more of a reset when I wake up like this so it doesn't bleed into the rest of the day. 

Still managed to get a reasonable amount of work done, followed by some Diablo (I was right, this rules) and dinner with Kate. Also managed to watch the Dungeons & Comedians live stream, which was lovely.

Hopefully more energetic tomorrow because today I didn't even do any goals.

# Day 7: Wednesday 1 April

Goals for today:

- [x] Component Library workshop
- [ ] Clean kitchen
- [x] Take out rubbish
- [x] D&D with Jen and Flinn

The workshop went really well! Glad I put so much time into prepping it. D&D was also super fun. It's nice to do silly things with pals.

Feeling a little more relaxed today in general, which is nice. I should do a workout tomorrow, though, it's been a few days.
