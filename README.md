Woke up about 6:30; flicked through Twitter and checked in on Pen Island. Animal Crossing is cute as hell but even by day 3 it's starting to feel a little hollow. Perhaps it's just meant to be meditative? Anyway, it's not quite hitting the spot after 150+ hours in Breath of the Wild. Maybe it's time for another Diablo playthrough (Demon Hunter?): something I don't have to think about too much and won't give me any stress, but with a little more pace.

Work is easy to get absorbed in. Plenty to do, including things I've been putting off for a while, so it's a nice balance between what I'm "supposed" to be doing and what's going to keep me occupied/satisfied. It's a win/win because I'm getting more done with fewer interruptions, and the bonus outcome is some nice features I wouldn't have had time to work on normally.

Kicking myself for forgetting to buy new guitar strings before it was too late. My acoustic sorely needs them, and trying to play it now will be a bad time. So I guess I treat that as a creative constraint, and play more with electric, bass, or ukulele. I'd love to say I'd finally have the time to mess around with a keyboard a little more, but I think realistically that ship has sailed.

Still looking for a really meaty side project. I do have a half-finished Sudoku solver that I could put more time into: the solvers for the harder techniques are really nice self-contained challenges and I could easily knock one of them off every couple of days.

## Remember to buy

- [ ] Eraser
- [ ] Flea treatment for Trip
- [ ] Beer (I know but honestly)
