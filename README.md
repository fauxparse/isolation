# Day 1: Thursday 26 March

Goals today:

- [x] Set up this repo
- [x] Clean the bathroom sink
- [x] Clear the dining table
- [x] Cook a delicious chicken and mushroom pasta bake
- [x] Video calls
    - [x] Kyle & Jack
    - [x] Julie
    - [x] Locomotive crew

Woke up about 6:30; flicked through Twitter and checked in on Pen Island. Animal Crossing is cute as hell but even by day 3 it's starting to feel a little hollow. Perhaps it's just meant to be meditative? Anyway, it's not quite hitting the spot after 150+ hours in Breath of the Wild. Maybe it's time for another Diablo playthrough (Demon Hunter?): something I don't have to think about too much and won't give me any stress, but with a little more pace.

Work is easy to get absorbed in. Plenty to do, including things I've been putting off for a while, so it's a nice balance between what I'm "supposed" to be doing and what's going to keep me occupied/satisfied. It's a win/win because I'm getting more done with fewer interruptions, and the bonus outcome is some nice features I wouldn't have had time to work on normally.

Kicking myself for forgetting to buy new guitar strings before it was too late. My acoustic sorely needs them, and trying to play it now will be a bad time. So I guess I treat that as a creative constraint, and play more with electric, bass, or ukulele. I'd love to say I'd finally have the time to mess around with a keyboard a little more, but I think realistically that ship has sailed.

Still looking for a really meaty side project. I do have a half-finished Sudoku solver that I could put more time into: the solvers for the harder techniques are really nice self-contained challenges and I could easily knock one of them off every couple of days.

### Later

I did everything I said I was gonna do today! I also:

- [x] Downloaded a new workout app (thanks Julie)
- [x] Went for a walk
- [x] Started a jigsaw puzzle
- [x] Watched a shit-ton of The Wire (finished S1 and a good chunk of S2)

### Grateful for

* 💻 Video chat man, oh my god. I cannot imagine what this would be like without it.
* 🥚 The two perfectly-poached eggs I made for lunch.
* 🍷 The unopened bottle of pinot gris I found in the fridge unexpectedly.
* 👩🏻 Tara's sage and well-informed advice. That woman is working her butt off to keep us all alive.
* 💪 That actually goes for everyone working to keep NZ healthy, but Tara's my fav.

# Day 2: Friday 27 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Fold all the washing
- [x] Clean the kitchen
- [x] Start a "to-watch" list

Up at 8 after a much deeper sleep. So many vivid social-distancing-themed dreams. Also I think there was some karaoke in there?

Also I'm super hungry, which isn't great. Once I get done with this morning's meetings I'll get some breakfast inside my body. Fridays are so meeting-heavy in general, which is going to be interesting: I find meetings exhausting in person and even more so over a video link, so today when I have like five hours of meetings it's gonna feel like a (quick maths) 13-hour day.

Looking forward to my first Bubble Visit later on. I'm pretty certain it's all above board, I'm just nervous things will tighten up in a few days and I'll be stuck by myself 😬

Friday, lessgo.

# Day 3: Saturday 28 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Clean the bathroom
- [ ] Finish my jigsaw

Didn't really finish this yesterday — forgot to do my gratitude stuff etc. So, I'm grateful for my lil bubble. Spent the evening on House Party and playing Trivial Pursuit, which was fun.

The weather this morning is real crappy, which wouldn't ordinarily be a problem except my house is SO LOUD when it rains. So I made some brunch and now I'm curled up on the couch making plans for the day but it's already 1pm.

But it's the weekend. I don't have to have a plan, right? Right?

### Update

I did none of these things! None of them! I didn't even do my workout! And I'm completely fine with that. It's Saturday baybee.

# Day 4: Sunday 29 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Tidy up a bit
- [x] Relax
- [ ] FaceTime with Rachelle in NYC
- [x] Movie date
- [x] Investigate Improfest Online

Went to the supermarket this morning for the first time. So weird. Also, some people really don't know how far two metres is, or even how many people one person from your household is. Surprised myself by getting a bunch of stuff for meals I wouldn't normally cook and feeling positive, even excited, about the idea. I don't know how it'll turn out afterwards, but for now I'm trying to use the extra time and energy in a positive way. Slightly annoyed at myself that I forgot to ask Kate if she needed anything before I went, but also I forgot flour, so I might need to go back anyway.

Not sure what I'll end up doing today. At the moment I'm watching TV with the subtitles on because the rain is too loud, which means I can't just have it on in the background while I do other things, but I'm kind of feeling like Doing A Project.

### Later

Spent a chunk of the afternoon reading Shakespeare's Comedy Of Errors (aggressively abridged) over a Zoom call for Lyndon's birthday, and it was very silly fun. Then I cooked my favourite pasta (pumpkin and caramelised onion ravioli — just from a packet, but delicious and relatively inexpensive), browned some butter to go with it (a first) and promptly burned my tongue (sadly not a first). So any ensuing anosmia is not (necessarily) a symptom.

Apart from that, I've spent most of the day lying on the couch with Trip on my chest watching TV, including watching (and live-tweeting) most of The Fellowship Of The Ring. It's... very silly. Needs some drastic editing: it could make a very decent 110 or so minutes, but 3 hours? No thanks.

"Back" "to" "work" tomorrow. Some stuff didn't get done this weekend, but also I haven't devolved into some kind of blanket-fort troglodyte quite yet, which is oddly surprising. I'm at peace with my decisions.

- [x] Set up shared grocery list with Kate
- [x] Did workout (ugh, cardio this time)
- [x] Checked Animates order: not yet picked up by NZ Post
- [ ] Still didn't finish the jigsaw. It taunts me.

### Grateful for

- 🏪 Supermarket staff
- 💻 Internet connectivity
- 🍳 Easy recipes
- 🐈 Cat snugs
- 🥵 A workout that only lasts 8 minutes

# Day 5: Monday 30 March

I have a headache. **It is just a headache.**

I totalled it up and I have 18 hours of video calls scheduled for work this week. This is clearly unsustainable. At least, I hope it is. EIGHTEEN HOURS.

Apart from those two things, I'm good. Just had a whole-family video chat for Tim's birthday, and I'm very glad I got him an entirely digital present (even before all this happened). Ihaia and Tāwera sent me pictures to go in my picture frames, but I think I'm just gonna put them up on the wall in the study.

I'm also extremely happy to report that before I started work this morning I put a bunch of pork and juices and spices into my slow cooker, so in a couple of hours I should be ready to take that out, break it up with forks, and crisp it in the oven for some delicious carnitas to put in tacos forever (1.2kg pork divided by just me equals a lot of porks per me).

Also spent some time today helping Brendon out with Dungeons & Comedians, which was very fun. I need to finish making my character for Wednesday's D&D session (unrelated), or at least come up with a name.

I'm feeling alright. I'm hearing a lot more people noise outside than I'd expect, though 🤔

Retrospective goals for today:

- [x] Cook some delicious pork
- [x] Clean up after myself
- [ ] Name my character
- [x] Draw pictures for Ihaia and Tāwera
- [ ] Finish FotR?
- [x] Watch more Veronica Mars

# Day 6: Tuesday 31 March

A rough night, bad sleep, gross dreams. Got to work out how to do more of a reset when I wake up like this so it doesn't bleed into the rest of the day. 

Still managed to get a reasonable amount of work done, followed by some Diablo (I was right, this rules) and dinner with Kate. Also managed to watch the Dungeons & Comedians live stream, which was lovely.

Hopefully more energetic tomorrow because today I didn't even do any goals.

# Day 7: Wednesday 1 April

Goals for today:

- [x] Component Library workshop
- [ ] Clean kitchen
- [x] Take out rubbish
- [x] D&D with Jen and Flinn

The workshop went really well! Glad I put so much time into prepping it. D&D was also super fun. It's nice to do silly things with pals.

Feeling a little more relaxed today in general, which is nice. I should do a workout tomorrow, though, it's been a few days.

# Day 8: Thursday 2 April

I have been on video calls literally all day. It's 4:30pm and my butt hurts from sitting at my desk. I'm hungry, I'm tired, and I don't have the energy to exercise or prepare food. Now is the time I would normally order delivery and go for a walk once I've eaten, but obviously that's not an option. I'm just gonna collapse for a bit and see how I feel when my brain's stopped leaking out my ears.

# Day 9: Friday 3 April

Thursday broke me a little. Took the day pretty easy and talked to Julie about setting up "Zoom-free Wednesdays", where I'm still working but just not available on calls. That gives me one or two days' break after every two days with calls. Seems doable?

Other than that, I played a bunch of Diablo and watched some more TV. Went to the supermarket in the evening and it's crazy to see the changes that have happened in a week. By the time I left, the queue stretched all the way through the trolley area, down the side of the building, and around three sides of the block. I know it's spaced out, and it was moving quite quickly, but still. Stocked up on some meals that require a little less preparation. Slow and steady.

# Day 10: Saturday 4 April

Had a good sleep-in this morning, then took groceries over to Kate and watched last week's Drag Race. A nice relaxing reset at the end of a tough week.

Still haven't finished my jigsaw.

Goals for today:

- [x] clean kitchen
- [x] soak laundry
- [x] make some pasta???

# Day 11: Sunday 5 April

Goals for today:

- [x] clean kitchen (again)
- [x] change sheets etc
- [x] lots of room for ACTIVITIES

I finished my jigsaw last night! Also the pasta was very good. Then I had a very solid sleep (daylight savings switch and all). Got up not too late, cleaned up from last night and threw some washing on, all before I even had a shower.

AND THEN I spent most of the day away from screens, playing solo board games (Wingspan and Scythe). A very wholesome and relaxing day that has hopefully set me up well for a fresh start on work tomorrow.

Also started planning a quiz night and a D&D game for next weekend. ACTIVITIEEEES.

# Day 17: Saturday 11 April

It's been... some days. I kept meaning to come back and update this, but I'm getting back to feeling busy, like things are *happening*. Which I guess is good?

Constantly behind on chores: there are always, always dishes to do, and the sofa is getting more and more cluttery. I should fix that.

I've been doing some Projects! Last night was our Lads! Lads! Lads! video quiz, which was a pretty great success, even if I did come last (my fault for organising two rounds, I suppose). But a delightful time, and we all agreed we should do another one.

Then today I ran a "D&D for beginners" session. This was an idea I started to formulate last weekend: there are lots of people home by themselves, and D&D is having one of its perennial popularity surges. So I wanted to see if I could create an environment that made D&D as friendly as possible to beginners over a remote connection. I started by sending out a survey about the type of character someone was interested in, and built characters from their answers (unsurprisingly, I got a LOT of orphans). Then I sent the characters back out as greatly simplified character sheets: no numbers at all except their own hit points and the amount of damage their weapons/spells caused (so they had a kind of rough idea of what big damage was when they were in combat). I also made a one-page guide to the kinds of things they could do. Then I spent a couple of days coming up with a short scenario for them to play through — my first time doing this EVER. It was a lot of work. But the results were extremely fun. I rolled all the dice for the players, trying as much as possible to explain what I was doing at every step. They loved it! I was really happy with their creative approach to solving the problems (including some out-and-out pacifism) and the monsters didn't kill them (although one character got down to 0HP).

*THEN* I watched Hackers while in an IRC chat with pals and I cooked a frozen pizza because I couldn't order delivery and it was perfect. A Good Day.

# Day 18: Sunday 12 April
