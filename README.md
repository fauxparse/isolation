# Day 1: Thursday 26 March

Goals today:

- [x] Set up this repo
- [x] Clean the bathroom sink
- [x] Clear the dining table
- [x] Cook a delicious chicken and mushroom pasta bake
- [x] Video calls
    - [x] Kyle & Jack
    - [x] Julie
    - [x] Locomotive crew

Woke up about 6:30; flicked through Twitter and checked in on Pen Island. Animal Crossing is cute as hell but even by day 3 it's starting to feel a little hollow. Perhaps it's just meant to be meditative? Anyway, it's not quite hitting the spot after 150+ hours in Breath of the Wild. Maybe it's time for another Diablo playthrough (Demon Hunter?): something I don't have to think about too much and won't give me any stress, but with a little more pace.

Work is easy to get absorbed in. Plenty to do, including things I've been putting off for a while, so it's a nice balance between what I'm "supposed" to be doing and what's going to keep me occupied/satisfied. It's a win/win because I'm getting more done with fewer interruptions, and the bonus outcome is some nice features I wouldn't have had time to work on normally.

Kicking myself for forgetting to buy new guitar strings before it was too late. My acoustic sorely needs them, and trying to play it now will be a bad time. So I guess I treat that as a creative constraint, and play more with electric, bass, or ukulele. I'd love to say I'd finally have the time to mess around with a keyboard a little more, but I think realistically that ship has sailed.

Still looking for a really meaty side project. I do have a half-finished Sudoku solver that I could put more time into: the solvers for the harder techniques are really nice self-contained challenges and I could easily knock one of them off every couple of days.

### Later

I did everything I said I was gonna do today! I also:

- [x] Downloaded a new workout app (thanks Julie)
- [x] Went for a walk
- [x] Started a jigsaw puzzle
- [x] Watched a shit-ton of The Wire (finished S1 and a good chunk of S2)

### Grateful for

* 💻 Video chat man, oh my god. I cannot imagine what this would be like without it.
* 🥚 The two perfectly-poached eggs I made for lunch.
* 🍷 The unopened bottle of pinot gris I found in the fridge unexpectedly.
* 👩🏻 Tara's sage and well-informed advice. That woman is working her butt off to keep us all alive.
* 💪 That actually goes for everyone working to keep NZ healthy, but Tara's my fav.

# Day 2: Friday 27 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Fold all the washing
- [x] Clean the kitchen
- [x] Start a "to-watch" list

Up at 8 after a much deeper sleep. So many vivid social-distancing-themed dreams. Also I think there was some karaoke in there?

Also I'm super hungry, which isn't great. Once I get done with this morning's meetings I'll get some breakfast inside my body. Fridays are so meeting-heavy in general, which is going to be interesting: I find meetings exhausting in person and even more so over a video link, so today when I have like five hours of meetings it's gonna feel like a (quick maths) 13-hour day.

Looking forward to my first Bubble Visit later on. I'm pretty certain it's all above board, I'm just nervous things will tighten up in a few days and I'll be stuck by myself 😬

Friday, lessgo.

# Day 3: Saturday 28 March

Goals today:

- [ ] Clean the bathroom
- [ ] Finish my jigsaw

Didn't really finish yesterday — forgot to do my gratitude stuff etc. So, I'm grateful for my lil bubble. Spent the evening on House Party and playing Trivial Pursuit, which was fun.

The weather this morning is real crappy, which wouldn't ordinarily be a problem except my house is SO LOUD when it rains. So I made some brunch and now I'm curled up on the couch making plans for the day but it's already 1pm.

But it's the weekend. I don't have to have a plan, right? Right?
